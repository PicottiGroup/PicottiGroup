Our laboratory studies how **protein conformational changes** impact cellular networks both in normal physiology and in disease. The lab develops
new mass spectrometric methods to monitor changes in the **structure** and **function** of proteins on a **proteome-wide scale** in biological samples like cells or tissues. These methods are applied in particular to study the effects of **protein aggregation** in **neurodegenerative disease**, with a focus on Parkinson's disease.

## LiP-MS
We developed a **structural proteomics technique**, limited proteolysis coupled to mass spectrometry (LiP-MS), which monitors protein conformational changes across the **entire detectable proteome**, in directly from **complex samples** [(Feng et al. Nat Biotechnology, 2014)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2999). The resulting **dynamic 3D proteomes** can be integrated into **functional proteomics screens** to provide far more informative snapshots of complex proteome dynamics than can be obtained from protein expression screens alone. These structural proteomics screens detect protein functional changes due to numerous molecular events
(e.g. **catalysis**, **allostery**, **protein-protein interactions** and **protein aggregation**) simultaneously and in situ with a resolution of single functional sites [(Cappelletti et al. Cell, 2021)](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31691-3?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420316913%3Fshowall%3Dtrue). 

We applied LiP-MS to the study of protein aggregation and discovered molecular [regulators of the toxicity](https://www.cell.com/cell-systems/fulltext/S2405-4712(19)30267-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS2405471219302674%3Fshowall%3Dtrue) of the amyloidogenic protein alpha-synuclein, involved in Parkinsonâ€™s disease. We also identified the determinants of [protein and proteome thermostability](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aai7825?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%20%200pubmed) and generated a map of [protein-metabolite interactions](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(17)31448-4?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867417314484%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).
